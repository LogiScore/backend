# Trial Reminder System - Implementation Complete

## üéØ Overview

The trial reminder system has been successfully implemented in the LogiScore backend. This system automatically sends email notifications to users when their free trials are ending and when trials have ended.

## üìß Implemented Features

### 1. API Endpoints

Three new API endpoints have been added to `/routes/notifications.py`:

- **POST** `/api/notifications/send-trial-warning` - Send trial ending warning (1 day before)
- **POST** `/api/notifications/send-trial-ended` - Send notification when trial has ended
- **GET** `/api/notifications/trials-ending-soon` - Get list of users whose trials end soon

### 2. Email Service Extensions

Two new methods added to `EmailService` class in `/email_service.py`:

- `send_trial_ending_warning()` - Sends warning email 1 day before trial ends
- `send_trial_ended_notification()` - Sends notification when trial has ended

### 3. Background Job Script

Created `/scripts/check_trial_expiry.py` for automated trial checking:

- Checks for trials ending in specified time window
- Sends appropriate email notifications
- Supports dry-run mode for testing
- Comprehensive logging

### 4. Shell Script

Created `/scripts/run_trial_check.sh` for easy execution:

- Sets up environment variables
- Creates logs directory
- Runs the trial check script

## üöÄ Usage

### Manual Testing

```bash
# Test the API endpoints directly
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/notifications/send-trial-warning" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "user_id": "user-uuid",
    "trial_duration": 7,
    "plan_name": "Subscription Monthly",
    "plan_price": 38,
    "billing_cycle": "month",
    "trial_end_date": "2024-01-15T23:59:59Z",
    "plan_features": ["Feature 1", "Feature 2"]
  }'
```

### Automated Background Job

```bash
# Run trial check (dry run)
./scripts/run_trial_check.sh --dry-run

# Run trial check for real
./scripts/run_trial_check.sh

# Check trials ending in next 12 hours
./scripts/run_trial_check.sh --hours-ahead 12

# Process trials that have already ended
./scripts/run_trial_check.sh --process-ended
```

### Cron Job Setup

Add to crontab for daily execution at 9 AM UTC:

```bash
# Edit crontab
crontab -e

# Add this line
0 9 * * * /path/to/LogiScore/backend/scripts/run_trial_check.sh
```

## üìä Email Templates

- **Content**: 
  - Trial details and countdown
  - Plan features and pricing
  - Call-to-action buttons (Continue/Cancel)
  - Professional styling with LogiScore branding

### Trial Ended Notification Email

  - Free tier capabilities
  - Subscribe now button
  - Professional styling with LogiScore branding

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `BACKEND_API_URL` - Backend API base URL (default: http://localhost:8000)
- `ADMIN_API_TOKEN` - Admin token for API authentication
- `SENDGRID_API_KEY` - SendGrid API key for email sending
- `SENDGRID_EU_RESIDENCY` - Set to 'true' for EU data residency

### Plan Configuration

The system supports three subscription tiers:

- **Monthly**: $38/month
- **Annual**: $418/year  
- **Enterprise**: $3450/year

Plan features are automatically included based on the subscription tier.

## üìù Logging

All trial reminder activities are logged to:

- `logs/trial_expiry_check.log` - Background job logs
- Console output for real-time monitoring

Log levels include INFO, WARNING, and ERROR for comprehensive monitoring.

## ‚úÖ Testing

The implementation has been tested and verified:

- ‚úÖ API endpoints are properly registered
- ‚úÖ Email service methods work correctly
- ‚úÖ Background script runs without errors
- ‚úÖ Dry-run mode functions properly
- ‚úÖ Error handling is comprehensive
- ‚úÖ Logging is detailed and useful

## üîÑ Integration with Frontend

The frontend can now use these API endpoints to:

1. **Send trial warnings** - Call `/send-trial-warning` with user and trial data
2. **Send trial ended notifications** - Call `/send-trial-ended` when trials expire
3. **Get trials ending soon** - Call `/trials-ending-soon` to get user lists

## üìã Next Steps

1. **Set up cron job** for automated daily execution
2. **Configure environment variables** in production
3. **Test with real trial subscriptions**
4. **Monitor email delivery** and user engagement
5. **Adjust timing** if needed based on user behavior

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Notes

- All API endpoints require proper authentication
- Admin token is required for background job execution
- Email addresses are validated before sending
- User data is properly sanitized in email templates

## üìû Support

For questions or issues with the trial reminder system:

1. Check the logs in `logs/trial_expiry_check.log`
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Test with dry-run mode first
4. Contact the development team for assistance

**Implementation completed successfully!** üéâ

The trial reminder system is now ready for production use and will help improve trial conversion rates by keeping users informed about their trial status.
