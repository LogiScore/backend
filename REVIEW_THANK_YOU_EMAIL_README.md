## Implementation Details

### Database Queries
The endpoint performs the following database operations:
1. Retrieves the review by ID
2. Fetches the freight forwarder information
3. Gets user details (if not anonymous)
4. Retrieves all category scores for the review

### Email Service Integration
- Uses the existing `EmailService` class
- Integrates with SendGrid for email delivery
- Includes fallback logging for development environments
- Supports EU data residency configuration

### Security Considerations
- Only sends emails to authenticated users (not anonymous reviews)
- Validates review ownership and existence
- Logs all email operations for audit purposes

## Usage Examples

### Frontend Integration
```javascript
// After successful review submission
const response = await fetch('/api/email/review-thank-you', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
        review_id: submittedReviewId
    })
});

if (response.ok) {
    const result = await response.json();
    console.log('Thank you email sent to:', result.email_sent_to);
}
```

### cURL Example
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/email/review-thank-you" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"review_id": "your-review-uuid-here"}'
```

## Testing

A test script `test_review_thank_you_email.py` is provided to verify the endpoint functionality:

```bash
python test_review_thank_you_email.py
```

**Note:** Update the `review_id` in the test script with an actual review ID from your database.

## Dependencies

- FastAPI
- SQLAlchemy
- SendGrid Python library
- Existing LogiScore database models and email service

## Environment Variables

The endpoint uses the same environment variables as the existing email service:
- `SENDGRID_API_KEY`: SendGrid API key for email delivery
- `FROM_EMAIL`: Sender email address
- `FROM_NAME`: Sender name
- `SENDGRID_EU_RESIDENCY`: EU data residency setting (optional)

## Error Handling

The endpoint includes comprehensive error handling:
- Input validation
- Database error handling
- Email service error handling
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Detailed error messages for debugging

## Logging

All operations are logged for monitoring and debugging:
- Successful email sends

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
